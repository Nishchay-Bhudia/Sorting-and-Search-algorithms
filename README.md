# Sorting-and-Search-algorithms
A collection of classic sorting and searching algorithms implemented in Python, featuring step-by-step visualisations using Matplotlib. This project helps demonstrate how algorithms like Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort,Binary Search, and more work internally, making learning algorithm behaviour interactive and easy to understand.
